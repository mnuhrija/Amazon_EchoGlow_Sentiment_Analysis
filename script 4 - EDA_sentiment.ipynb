Long story short I have a baby due late august and was going to use the glow in the nursery, well my lovely rabbit decided the cord was going to be a snack and ate straight through it. Tried to buy a replacement cord and it you can’t even replace the cord. I’m so sad because it’s such a great night light! I bought as a 2 pc set with the Echo Kids. My fault about the rabbit but I just wish the cord was replaceable or could be bought separately vs having to purchase a whole new Echo Glow at $30 vs the $15 I paid for the set.'"
